VR Nanodegree Course 3 Project
Name:- Nihar Mamidipudi
Duration to complete the project 7 months
VRND Course 3 Starter Project old version was used in this project.

The project is a simple maze game with coins scattered all over the maze and a key that needs to be collected in order to complete the game. My feedback for the project is as follows, 
this project was highly challenging and misleading at the same time because I have no absolute idea of C# scripting and before enrolling for the course I was told that knowing C# scripting wouldn't be mandatory but I was wrong. Nevertheless it was a good learning experience.
